_The quality of early connections to loved ones, especially maternal figures, plays a critical role in shaping personality, emotional regulation, and habitual ways of connecting with others._

**Examples:**

- Children with warmer, more responsive mothers tend to develop better self-regulation and emotional stability.
- Children with colder, dismissive, or unpredictable mothers may become detached, angry, or struggle with emotional regulation.
- Infant primates separated from their mothers grow into socially and emotionally impaired adults, unable to form healthy relationships or interpret social cues.
