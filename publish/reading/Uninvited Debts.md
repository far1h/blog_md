_A person can create a sense of obligation in others by doing an unsolicited favor, leveraging the cultural and social pressures of the rule of reciprocation._

**Examples:**
- Feeling obligated to repay a favor that was neither requested nor wanted.
- Marcel Mauss describes the "obligation to give, receive, and repay" in gift-giving practices.
- A person controls both the initial favor and the expected return, leaving the recipient in a difficult social position to refuse.
