_The notion that emotions in relationships should be suppressed or controlled, with dependency on others seen as a sign of weakness or dysfunction._

**Examples:**
- Viewing emotional dependence in relationships as unhealthy, labeling individuals as “enmeshed” or “codependent.”
- Advocating for self-sufficiency and emotional restraint as key to maintaining healthy adult relationships.
- Therapists encouraging individuals to avoid emotional reliance on their partners.

“First they said that emotion was something
         that adults should control. Indeed, that too much emotion was the basic problem in most marriages. It should be overcome,
         not listened to or indulged. But most important, they argued, healthy adults are self-sufficient. Only dysfunctional people
         need or depend on others. We had names for these people: they were enmeshed, codependent, merged, fused. In other words, they were messed up. Spouses depending on each other too much was what wrecked marriages!”
