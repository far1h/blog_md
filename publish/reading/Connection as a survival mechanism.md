_The innate drive to form emotional attachments with a few irreplaceable individuals is essential for physical, mental, and emotional health, ensuring survival and well-being._

**Examples:**

- Emotional attachments are wired into our genes as a survival mechanism, as described by John Bowlby and inspired by Charles Darwinâ€™s theories on natural selection.
- Historical accounts, such as children in foundling homes dying from sadness or orphaned children suffering from emotional deprivation, highlight the critical need for emotional bonds.
- Married individuals generally live longer than their single peers due to the health benefits of close emotional connections.
- Loneliness increases the risk of heart attack and stroke, with emotional isolation posing a greater health risk than smoking or high blood pressure.
