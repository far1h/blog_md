_Atomic habits are small, consistent routines that form the building blocks of larger systems, driving remarkable long-term results._

**Examples:**
- A 1 percent daily improvement builds on itself to create significant progress over time.
- Just as atoms form the foundation of molecules, atomic habits form the foundation of extraordinary achievements.
- Small routines, like writing a single sentence daily or doing a 5-minute workout, multiply into bigger wins over time.
