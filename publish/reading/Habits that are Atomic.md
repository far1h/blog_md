_Atomic habits are small, consistent routines that form the building blocks of larger systems, driving remarkable long-term results._

**Examples:**
- A 1 percent daily improvement builds on itself to create significant progress over time.
- Just as atoms form the foundation of molecules, atomic habits form the foundation of extraordinary achievements.
- Small routines, like writing a single sentence daily or doing a 5-minute workout, multiply into bigger wins over time.

“By now, you’ve probably realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.
Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.
