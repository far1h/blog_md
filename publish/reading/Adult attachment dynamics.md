_The emotional bonds adults form with their partners are shaped by the same attachment needs observed in children, influencing behavior, self-perception, and relationship quality._

**Examples:**

- Adults, like children, seek attachment to feel secure and supported, as demonstrated by Bowlbyâ€™s studies of World War II widows.
- Securely attached individuals are better at giving and receiving support, forgiving partners, and maintaining a positive self-image even when acknowledging their flaws.
- When secure, adults can reach out and connect easily; when insecure, they may become anxious, controlling, or avoidant.
