**Overview**:  
TimePossible is a health and activity manager app designed to integrate with Apple's Health and Calendar apps, helping users streamline their health goals and daily activities.

**Description**:  
Developed as the final project in my software engineering course, TimePossible was built over three months, where I led iOS development with UI/UX support from designers Dian Tan and Nadya Naftalie. The app includes personalized health and event recommendations, HealthKit integration, and scheduling conflict management, providing a comprehensive tool for users to manage their health and daily activities effectively.
