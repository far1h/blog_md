Locally-redundant storage (LRS):
Lowest-cost option with <u>basic protection against server rack and drive failures</u>. Recommended for **non-critical scenarios**.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS):
Intermediate option with <u>failover capabilities in a secondary region</u>.
Recommended for **backup scenarios**.

Zone-redundant storage (ZRS):
Intermediate option with protection against <u>datacenter-level failures</u>.
Recommended for **high availability scenarios**.

Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS):
Optimal data protection solution that <u>includes the offerings of both GRS and
ZRS</u>. Recommended for **critical data scenarios**.
