#### rules
1. no left recursive and left factoring
2. find [[First]] values (as many grammars that we have)  
3. find [[Follow]] value (as many grammars that we have)  
4. make parsing table  
5. search through the parsing  
#### Example: 
1. _E_ -> *TE'*
2. E' -> *+TE'* | $\varepsilon$
3. *T* -> *FT'*
4. *T'* -> *\*FT'* | $\varepsilon$
5. *F* -> *(E)* | *id*
### [[First]] Values:
1. [[First]] E = \(, id `(this is from E -> T -> F)`
2. [[First]] E' =  +, $\varepsilon$
3. [[First]] T = (, id
4. [[First]] T' = \*, $\varepsilon$
5. [[First]] F = (, id

### [[Follow]] Values:

1. [[Follow]] E = $, )  
2. [[Follow]] E' = $, )  
   *E* -> *T**E'***  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  
3. [[Follow]] T = +, $, ) 
   > use algorithm 2 and 3b because there is an $\varepsilon$  

   _E_ -> *TE'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  `(T is at position $\alpha$ so can't use this grammar)`  
   E' -> *+TE'* `(we dont write $\varepsilon$ because it doesn't contain T)`  
   *A* -> $\alpha$*B*$\beta$  
4. [[Follow]] T' =   +, $, ) 
   *T* -> *FT'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  
5. [[Follow]] F = \*, +, $, )  
   *T'* -> *\*FT'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$*B*$\beta$   

### Parsing Table
> Rows: Variables  
> Columns: Terminals, and Values

How to fill the table?  
1. Look at the first of each variable, and fill where we got the first values  
2. If there is an $\varepsilon$ at the first, then look at follow value of the variable and write the variable -> $\varepsilon$  for the follow values

Notes:
E id = `(we started from the this and later found id)`  
E' + = `(we got this from it's own production values)`  
E ( =`(we started from this and later found ()`  

   ## Parsing Search

> The first stack is the start symbol and add $ before it

> Input will be given

How to determine the output?
- By comparing the right most of the stack and the left most of the input 

Rules
- Stack gets replaced by the production values or the thing that comes after the `->` but reverse it
- If `stack == input` POP STACK AND INPUT
- if there is $\varepsilon$ after -> POP STACK
- if `stack == $` and `input == $` ACCEPT
- if stack `â‰ ` input REJECT

| stack       | input      | output               |
| ----------- | ---------- | -------------------- |
| $E          | id+id$     | _E_ -> *TE'*         |
| $E'T        | id+id$     | *T* -> *FT'*         |
| $E'T'F      | id+id$     | *F* -> *id*          |
| $E'T'~~id~~ | ~~id~~+id$ | pop id               |
| $E'T        | +id$       | *T'* ->$\varepsilon$ |
| $E'         | +id$       | E' -> *+TE'*         |
| $E'T~~+~~   | ~~+~~id$   | pop +                |
| $E'T        | id$        | *T* -> *FT'*         |
| $E'T'F      | id$        | *F* -> *id*          |
| $E'T'~~id~~ | ~~id~~$    | pop Id               |
| $E'T'       | $          | *T'* ->$\varepsilon$ |
| $E'         | $          | E' -> $\varepsilon$  |
