reference: [Alvina Aulia Top Down Parsing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpXMlZ5WipI&t=650s&ab_channel=AlvinaAulia)  

rules
1. no left recursive and left factoring
2. find [[First]] values (as many grammars that we have)
3. find [[Follow]] value (as many grammars that we have)
4. make parsing table

Example: 
1. _E_ -> *TE'*
2. E' -> *+TE'* | $\varepsilon$
3. *T* -> *FT'*
4. *T'* -> *\*FT'* | $\varepsilon$
5. *F* -> *(E)* | *id*

[[First]] Values:
1. [[First]] E = \(, id (this is from E -> T -> F) 
> why only use T??
2. [[First]] E' =  +, $\varepsilon$
3. [[First]] T = (, id
4. [[First]] T' = \*, $\varepsilon$
5. [[First]] F = (, id

[[Follow]] Values:

1. [[Follow]] E = $, )  
2. [[Follow]] E' = $, )  
   *E* -> *T**E'***  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  
3. [[Follow]] T = +, $, ) 
> use algorithm 2 and 3b because there is an $\varepsilon$

   _E_ -> *TE'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  (T is at position $\alpha$ so can't use this grammar)   
   E' -> *+TE'* (we dont write $\varepsilon$ because it doesn't contain T)  
   *A* -> $\alpha$*B*$\beta$  
4. [[Follow]] T' =   +, $, ) 
   *T* -> *FT'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$ *B*  
5. [[Follow]] F = \*, +, $, )  
   *T'* -> *\*FT'*  
   *A* -> $\alpha$*B*$\beta$
