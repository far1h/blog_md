> File allocation algorithms (contiguous, chained, indexed)

- File system resides on secondary storage (disks)
- File system divides disks into several blocks of sectors (usually 512 bytes)
- An allocation method refers to how disk blocks are allocated for files:
	- [[Contiguous]] (where the blocks that we use to store a file is **ordered**)
	- [[Linked]] (where one block is not entirely used to store data but pointers as well)
	- File Allocation Table (FAT)
