Meaning to combine data from multiple sources into a unified dataset while ensuring consistency and resolves conflicts from merging.

- _Schema Integration_ : making sure that the format and structure of data are the same across all sources.
- _Entity Identification_ : linking together entries that represent the same thing, even if they have different names.

In other words, it can be said that in many cases, **entity identification** happens **before schema integration**.

1. First, you need to know which data points from different systems refer to the same real-world entities (**entity identification**).
2. After that, ensure the structure, format, and naming conventions are the same across those matched entities (**schema integration**).
