Transfer rate
- Rate at which data flow between drive and computer

Positioning time (random-access time) consists of
- Seek time
	- Time to find the desired cylinder/track
- Rotational Delay
	- Time to find the desired sector

## Disk Scheduling
- The arrangement of how we access desired cylinders
- Start from the head pointer

FIFO
- Using the queue order

SSTF (Shorter Seek Time First)
- Find the closest

SCAN
- like an elevator scans to the bottom until the edge and scans back up again in reverse 
- 2 directions

CSCAN
- scans until the edge and goes back to the start in case any were missed like a type writer
- 1 direction

FSCAN

# RAID Configuration
- redundant array of inexpensive disks
- ex: NAS

> popular RAID levels are 0, 1, 5, 6

> Disk striping uses a group of disks as one storage unit (COMBINED)

![[Screenshot 2024-11-25 at 9.27.28 PM.png]]

> Mirroring or shadowing keeps duplicate of each disk

> Parity means like having a backup
