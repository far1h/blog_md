##### steps
1. Look for [[Three Address Code (TAC)]]
2. Create [[Directed Acyclic Graph|DAG]] based on [[Three Address Code (TAC)|TAC]]

> From left to right  

> Don't repeat any nodes
### Example [Alvina Aulia Directed Acyclic Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kp7ZWn-G1X8&ab_channel=AlvinaAulia)

![[Pasted image 20241231162515.png]]

T1 = b - c  
T2 = a \* T1  
T3 = T1 \* d  
T4 = a + T2  
T5 = T4 + T3  
x = T5
