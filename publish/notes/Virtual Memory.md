- virtual memory (due to many processes) can exceed the capacity of the physical memory
- use backing store as a mechanism to accomodate the limited memory resources
- backing store is usually taken from the hard disk and used for memory swapping

- when the requested page is not in the main memory it is considered a page fault

- there is a need for replacement when the main memory is full and does not have the requested page

> the goal is to make the least number of replacements

how page replacement works

# Page Replacement Algroithms

## First-In-First-Out (FIFO) Algorithm

> provided with a collection of pages that is needed by a process, and page frames that will store the pages 

- if empty just insert the page
- if full, we replace the oldest one or the first one that went in the page frames

## Optimal Algorithm

> in FIFO we compared it to the previous page frame, here we try to predict the future despite receiving the page requests one by one

- replace the page frame that is used later than the others
- ex: replace 7 since 7 is used the later after 0 and 1

> 9 page faults

## Least Recently Used (LRU) Algorithm

> similar to FIFO by comparing to the previous page frame

- replace the page that is not used the longest or least recently used
