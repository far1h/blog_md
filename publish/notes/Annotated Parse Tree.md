> always start from the first rule

> bring 2 color pens for dependency graph

> start from the lowest leaf for the graph (Depth First Search)

> if there no value yet go to a diff leaf 

> kind of brute force as long as it makes sense with the final result

> E1 is the child of E

> Execute the parent rule first then the child

> if no dependency graph is asked no need to draw arrows, just the values
