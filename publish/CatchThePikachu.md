**Overview**:  
"Catch the Pikachu" is an interactive iOS game where players tap to catch Pikachu as it randomly appears on the screen.

**Description**:  
Developed using UIKit, this game includes features like a countdown timer, score tracking, and high score storage via UserDefaults. The project strengthened my skills in gesture recognition, UI responsiveness, and state management, providing an engaging experience for users.
