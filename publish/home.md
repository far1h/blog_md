Project Description

TimePossible is a personal health and activity manager that seamlessly integrates with Apple's Calendar and Health apps, powered by OpenAI, developed as the final project of our software engineering course. Over three months, my team and I created a website and an iOS app, with me leading the iOS development using Swift, supported by talented UI/UX designers Dian Tan and Nadya Naftalie. The app offers features like personalized health and event recommendations, data syncing via HealthKit and Apple Calendar, conflict management for scheduling, and progress tracking for health goals, providing users with a comprehensive tool to manage their health and daily activities efficiently.

Project Description

TerraWander, developed during the iOS Foundation program, is a mobile app that uses VR nature experiences to help reduce stress among university students. As a team leader, I worked with Swift and RealityComposer under tight deadlines, overcoming challenges like limited time and resources. The project showcased my abilities in Swift programming, AR integration, and team management, while also highlighting the potential of VR for mental wellness

Project Description

This app provides an interactive experience to explore the animals of Indonesia and its national parks, utilizing MapKit for location-based features and LazyGrid for efficient data display. Developed with SwiftUI, the project involved learning how to decode JSON data, implement GRID layouts, use Codable, Extensions, and Generics, play video files, and create maps with annotations. It also included advanced features like creating a complex grid system (1 List + 3 Grids), optimizing layouts for iPad screens, transferring an iPad app to a desktop version using Mac Catalyst, and programmatically creating motion animations, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of SwiftUI development across multiple Apple platforms.
