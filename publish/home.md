Project Description

TimePossible is a personal health and activity manager that seamlessly integrates with Apple's Calendar and Health apps, powered by OpenAI, developed as the final project of our software engineering course. Over three months, my team and I created a website and an iOS app, with me leading the iOS development using Swift, supported by talented UI/UX designers Dian Tan and Nadya Naftalie. The app offers features like personalized health and event recommendations, data syncing via HealthKit and Apple Calendar, conflict management for scheduling, and progress tracking for health goals, providing users with a comprehensive tool to manage their health and daily activities efficiently.

Project Description

This app provides an interactive experience to explore the animals of Indonesia and its national parks, utilizing MapKit for location-based features and LazyGrid for efficient data display. Developed with SwiftUI, the project involved learning how to decode JSON data, implement GRID layouts, use Codable, Extensions, and Generics, play video files, and create maps with annotations. It also included advanced features like creating a complex grid system (1 List + 3 Grids), optimizing layouts for iPad screens, transferring an iPad app to a desktop version using Mac Catalyst, and programmatically creating motion animations, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of SwiftUI development across multiple Apple platforms.

# CICDiOS

https://github.com/far1h/CICDiOS

Project Description

During my first iOS project, I realized the inefficiencies of not using proper version control or automated testing. This led me to dive deep into CI/CD and automated testing after completing my software engineering course. I built a new iOS app from scratch using a structured branching strategy with feature, development, and main branches, integrating Microsoft AppCenter for continuous integration and delivery. This approach automated testing for every commit and ensured a stable codebase, marking a shift from ad-hoc development to a professional and scalable workflow. This experience underscored the importance of clean, maintainable code and modern DevOps practices, significantly improving code quality and team collaboration.

# CatchThePikachu

https://github.com/far1h/CatchThe PikachuGame
Project Description

I developed "Catch the Pikachu," an interactive iOS game that challenges players to catch Pikachu as it randomly appears on the screen. Built with UIKit, the game utilizes UIImageView to display Pikachu images and UITapGestureRecognizer for interactive tapping. The game features a countdown timer, score tracking, and high score storage using UserDefaults. Key functionalities include dynamically hiding and showing Pikachu with timers (Timer), and a responsive UI that allows players to replay the game with a simple alert dialog. This project enhanced my understanding of iOS development practices, including gesture recognition, UI updates, and state management.
